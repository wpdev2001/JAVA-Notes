What does following dependency is used for "jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl"?
==>
The dependency "jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl" is used for integrating the Jakarta Standard Tag Library (JSTL) into a Java web application.
JSTL is a collection of JSP custom tags used for common tasks such as iteration, conditional logic, and formatting. It simplifies JSP development by providing a set of standard tags that abstract away complex Java code.
To use JSTL in a Java web application, you need to include the appropriate JAR files in your project's dependencies. The "jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl" dependency typically refers to the JSTL implementation provided by the Jakarta EE specification.

Here's an example of how you might include this dependency in a Maven project's pom.xml file:

<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl-api</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.7</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.glassfish.web</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.7</version>
</dependency>
This configuration includes both the JSTL API (jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl-api) and the JSTL implementation (jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl). Make sure to adjust the version numbers as needed for your project.
Once you've added the JSTL dependency to your project, you can use JSTL tags in your JSP files to simplify common tasks and improve code readability.
