What are the various access specifiers in Java?
In Java, access specifiers are the keywords which are used to define the access scope of the method, class, or a variable. In Java, there are four access specifiers given below.
1. Public The classes, methods, or variables which are defined as public, can be accessed by any class or method.
2. Protected Protected can be accessed by the class of the same package, or by the sub-class of this class, or within the same class.
3. Default Default are accessible within the package only. By default, all the classes, methods, and variables are of default scope.
4. Private The private class, methods, or variables defined as private can be accessed within the class only.

// Class in the same package
class Parent {
    protected int protectedVar = 10;
    int defaultVar = 20; // default access
    
    public void show() {
        System.out.println(protectedVar);
        System.out.println(defaultVar);
    }
}

// Class in the same package
class Child extends Parent {
    public void display() {
        System.out.println(protectedVar); // Can access protected variable
        System.out.println(defaultVar); // Can access default variable (same package)
    }
}

// Class in a different package
package otherPackage;

import Parent; // Assuming the Parent class is in a different package

class AnotherChild extends Parent {
    public void display() {
        System.out.println(protectedVar); // Can access protected variable (from subclass)
        // System.out.println(defaultVar); // Error: Cannot access defaultVar (different package)
    }
}

Q] why java moves to functional programming?

Java's move towards functional programming (FP), particularly starting with the introduction of lambdas and Streams in Java 8, was driven by several key reasons that align with modern software development practices and the need to improve the expressiveness, efficiency, and scalability of Java applications. Here are some of the main motivations behind Java's adoption of functional programming features:

1. Increased Expressiveness and Conciseness
Functional programming encourages a more declarative style of programming, focusing on what to do rather than how to do it. By allowing developers to write more concise and readable code with constructs like lambdas and method references, Java can express complex operations in fewer lines of code.

Before Java 8: To process or filter collections, you would typically use loops or iterators, which can become verbose and harder to maintain.
After Java 8: Using Streams and lambdas, you can process collections in a declarative way, like list.stream().filter(x -> x > 10).forEach(System.out::println);, making code more concise and easier to read.
2. Improved Performance via Parallelization
One of the most powerful aspects of functional programming in Java is its support for parallel processing via the Stream API. Streams can be processed in parallel with minimal effort, which is a huge benefit for handling large datasets.

Parallel Streams: Java’s Stream API can take advantage of multi-core processors by automatically splitting data into chunks and processing them concurrently. This can dramatically improve performance on operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing data, especially on large datasets.
Example:

java
Copy code
list.parallelStream().filter(x -> x > 10).forEach(System.out::println);
The Stream API abstracts the parallelization logic, enabling developers to write more efficient code with very little additional effort.

3. Immutability and Safer Code
Functional programming emphasizes immutability — once data is created, it cannot be changed. This leads to fewer bugs due to side effects (where data changes unexpectedly) and easier reasoning about code.

Immutability reduces issues related to race conditions and concurrency, which are common in multi-threaded environments.
By using functional-style operations (such as map(), filter(), and reduce()), you can avoid changing the state of objects, leading to more predictable and reliable programs.
4. Better Handling of Higher-Order Functions
Functional programming allows higher-order functions, which means that functions can be passed as parameters or returned as values. This enables more flexible and reusable code. Java's introduction of lambda expressions allows it to adopt this feature, leading to cleaner and more modular designs.

Example: Passing functions as arguments allows operations to be parameterized, such as list.sort((a, b) -> a.compareTo(b)), or creating custom filter conditions.
5. Reactive Programming and Streams
The advent of functional programming in Java aligns with the growing trend of reactive programming, especially in modern web applications. Reactive programming focuses on working with streams of data and asynchronous events, which are well-suited to the Stream API and lambda expressions.

Java 8's Streams provide a functional approach to process data in a sequence of operations that can be lazily evaluated, providing a natural foundation for building reactive systems.
CompletableFuture and Reactive Streams are also examples of Java's adoption of functional concepts to handle asynchronous operations.
6. Compatibility with Modern Java Libraries and Frameworks
Modern Java libraries and frameworks, such as Spring, RxJava, and Akka, increasingly use functional programming paradigms. By incorporating functional programming features into Java, the language is more compatible with these libraries, allowing developers to take advantage of modern tools and frameworks while staying within the Java ecosystem.

For example, Spring WebFlux relies on functional-style reactive programming to handle asynchronous and non-blocking operations.
7. Maintainability and Readability
Functional programming promotes smaller, more focused functions that do one thing well. This can improve maintainability and readability, especially in large codebases, as functional code tends to be more modular and composed of simple, predictable building blocks.

Functions are often stateless and have clear inputs and outputs, making them easier to test, understand, and refactor.
This modularity helps developers write code that is easier to maintain and scale over time, especially in larger teams or complex systems.
8. Alignment with Industry Trends
As programming paradigms evolve, many modern languages, such as Scala, Kotlin, JavaScript, and Python, have embraced functional programming features. Java's move to support functional programming helps it stay relevant and competitive with these languages, especially in areas like data processing, concurrency, and web development.

9. Support for Declarative Programming
Java traditionally had an imperative programming style, where developers explicitly defined the steps to accomplish a task. Functional programming, on the other hand, encourages declarative programming, where you describe what you want to do, not how to do it.

Declarative code is generally easier to read and understand. It focuses on the intended result, abstracting away the low-level details of the underlying logic.
For example, using Streams to filter a collection is more about declaring the desired result (all elements greater than 10) than writing the explicit iteration logic.
Conclusion
Java’s move toward functional programming is part of a broader trend in software development where languages increasingly support a mix of paradigms. Functional programming in Java improves code conciseness, readability, and expressiveness, while also enabling better performance through parallelism and reactive programming. It aligns Java with modern industry trends and provides developers with powerful tools for writing clean, efficient, and scalable code.

This move makes Java a more versatile and modern language, suitable for a wider range of applications, from traditional enterprise systems to modern web applications and big data processing.
